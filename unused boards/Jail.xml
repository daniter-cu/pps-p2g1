<!-- Reason it's interesting / challenging: Since the rooms at the four corner act as partitioned
chambers in which mosquitos can become trapped, the player must realize that it will have to draw the
mosquitoes out from those places. Also, since the chambers are partitioned from each other, the player
should realize that and draw the mosquitoes out from each chamber separately.-->
